# Signal-Scope
Neural intelligence for seeing unseen signals. SignalScope observes agent behavior, flags anomalies, and teaches through design. A quiet system that speaks in clarity.
## 🧩 Integrated Modules

### 🔐 SecureListenerKit
A structured PowerShell-based toolkit nested within SignalScope, built to enforce intentional port hardening, real-time audit logging, and regulatory compliance respect—especially around state-owned devices.

**Location:** `SignalScope/SecureListenerKit/`

#### Included Tools:
- `PortDefense.ps1`: Applies explicit firewall rules for port exposure control
- `ListenerAudit.ps1`: Detects unauthorized listener activity and logs violations
- `ListenerManifest.md`: Documents trusted port philosophy and rule logic
- `PrivacyBoundary.md`: Excludes California BAR-certified systems from all scans and observability flows

> Security here isn't just technical—it’s philosophical. Every listener reflects intent, and every exclusion honors regulation.
